# Introduction
In this notebook, you will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. Your completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

# Setup

This project requires GPU acceleration to run efficiently. Support is available to use either of the following two methods for accessing GPU-enabled cloud computing resources.

## Install
- Python 3
- NumPy
- TensorFlow 1.x
- Keras 2.x

## Converting to HTML

There are several ways to generate an HTML copy of the notebook:

 - Running the last cell of the notebook will export an HTML copy

 - Navigating to **File -> Download as -> HTML (.html)** within the notebook

 - Using `nbconvert` from the command line

    $ pip install nbconvert
    $ nbconvert machine_translation.ipynb
